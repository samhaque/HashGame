# Hash Game
Fun little hash game that leverages Bcrypt and Flask to hash secret text in MongoDB for retrieval by users.

1. Users are given their respective hashes
2. Users must talk to each other and use the hash game site to exchange hashes for letters
3. Once enough letters have been decrypted users will be able to decode the indented secret using their CS skillz
